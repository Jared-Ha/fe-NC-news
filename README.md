# NC News Frontend

Check out the hosted version of my app [here](https://jh-nc-news.netlify.app/).

## Project Summary

Welcome to my NC News application. This is the frontend project I built during my coding bootcamp at Northcoders. Itâ€™s designed as a News-like platform where users can browse, filter, and interact with articles. The app allows users to log in as different existing users, post comments, vote on articles, and sort articles by various criteria. The frontend is built using React and Vite, ensuring a dynamic and responsive user experience across all devices.
